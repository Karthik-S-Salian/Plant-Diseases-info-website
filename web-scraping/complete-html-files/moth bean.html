                        <li>
                            The first symptom of the disease in the field is drooping of the plants followed by sudden death. The leaves may also turn yellow and drop off prematurely.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pod formation is severely affected. In collar regions of the wilted plants, necrosis and discolouration can be seen.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The diseased plants can be pulled out easily than the healthy ones.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When the diseased stem is cut, there is a dark brown, discoloured band around the vascular system. Infection occurs directly through the root hairs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The fungus survives for indefinite periods in the soil.

                        <li>
                            The disease symptom starts as yellowing of lower leaves, followed by drooping and defoliation.

                            The sudden death of plants is seen in patches. In the grown-up plants, the stem portion near the soil level shows large number of black pycnidia.

                        <li>

                            M. phaseolina survives as microsclerotia in the soil and on infected plant debris. The microsclerotia serve as the primary source of inoculum and have been found to persist within the soil up to three years.

                        <li>

                            Light greenish-yellow circles that look like halos form around a brown spot or lesion on the plant. With age, the lesions may join together as the leaf turns yellow and slowly dies.

                            Stem lesions appear as long, reddish spots. Leaves infected with common blight turn brown and drop quickly from the plant.
