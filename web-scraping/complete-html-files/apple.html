                            Leaf symptoms first occur early in the spring when the leaves are unfolding.

                        <li>
                            They appear as small, purple specks on the upper surface of the leaves that enlarge into circular lesions 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3-6 mm) in diameter.

                        <li>
                            The margin of the lesions remains purple, while the center turns tan to brown. In a few weeks, secondary enlargement of these leaf spots occurs.

                        <li>
                            Heavily infected leaves become chlorotic and defoliation occurs.

                        <li>
                            As the rotted area enlarges, a series of concentric bands of uniform width form which alternate in color from black to brown. The flesh of the rotted area remains firm and leathery. Black pycnidia are often seen on the surface of the infected fruit.

                            Phytophthora collar rot attacks the lower 30 inches (76 cm) of apple trunks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Most infections start at the junction of a lateral root with the trunk.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Infected bark becomes brown and is often soft and mushy or slimy when wet.

                        <li>
                            Dark streaks often occur near the cambium and extend beyond the canker margin. If a canker enlarges for several years, only the marginal areas show the typical color and texture of newly killed tissue.

                        <li>
                            The development of the canker is rapid, horizontally and vertically. The ultimate effect of collar rot is to girdle the affected limb, roots, or trunk, resulting in the death of that organ or of the entire tree.

                            Sooty Blotch:  Sooty blotch appears as sooty or cloudy blotches on the surface of the fruit. The blotches are olive green with an indefi nite outline.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The blotches are usually one fourth of an inch in diameter or larger, and may coalesce to cover much of the fruit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The “smudge” appearance results from the presence of hundreds of minute, dark pycnidia that are interconnected by a mass of loose, interwoven dark hyphae.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The sooty blotch fungus is generally restricted to the outer surface of the cuticle. In rare cases, the hyphae penetrate between the epidermal cell walls and the cuticle.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The individual “fly specks” are more widely scattered and much larger than the pycnidia of the sooty blotch fungus.

                        <li>
                            The flyspecks are sexual fruiting bodies (pseudothecia) of the fungus, and are interconnected by very fine hyphae. The blemishes can be removed by vigorous rubbing or bleaching.

                            Leaf spots appear on the leaves in late spring and early summer. Initially, they are 1/8 to 1/4 inch in diameter, round, brown, and occasionally have a purple border.

                            As spots age, they often turn tan to ash gray. Some spots undergo secondary enlargement, becoming irregularly shaped.

                            Heavily infected leaves often abscise, resulting in defoliation. (Defoliation is greater when mites are present.) Fruit infections result in small, dark, raised pimple-like lesions associated with the lenticels.

                            In fruit trees, the base of the trunk at soil level can show signs of a dark, wet rot, especially if kept moist by weeds or wet weather.

                        <li>

                            Trees develop a generally unthrifty appearance with leaf yellowing, cessation of root growth, small leaves, premature leaf fall and small, shrivelled fruit. Infected trees will eventually die.
