                            Symptoms can occur at both the seedling and plant developmental stages and appear as patches in the field The root system appears healthy, but with a reduced proliferation and nodulation rate.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In most cases, there is no discolouration of the vascular system. Other symptoms at the seedling stage include seed rot.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It usually occurs near or at the reproductive stages (flowering to pod-filling) of crop growth. Symptoms include the drooping and wilting of the uppermost leaflets . Plants become completely yellow and die. Plants are affected during the mid- to late-pod filling stages, seeds are often shrivelled

                            Chlamydospores of the pathogen can survive in the soil for many years in the absence of a host plant. The pathogen can also survive within infected plant material in the field. This indicates that the pathogen is well adapted to survive adverse conditions
