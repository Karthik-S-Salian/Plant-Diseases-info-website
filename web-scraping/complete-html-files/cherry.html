                            Cankers spread upwards and form sunken areas in winter; if pathogen enters dormant buds they may be killed or open normally in Spring before collapsing in early Summer; infected buds may be symptomless

                            Pseudomonas syringae survives on plant surfaces, is spread by splashing rain, and is favored by high moisture and low temperatures in spring.

                        <li>
                            The disease is worse in low or sandy spots in the orchard. Vigorous trees are less susceptible to bacterial canker, while young trees, 2 to 8 years old, are most affected. The disease rarely occurs in first year of planting, and is uncommon in nurseries.

                            Silver Leaf is a fungal disease and its name refers to the silver luster of leaves that occurs on some hosts
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            First sign of the disease is twig and branch die-back. Leaves that are affected may later start to show brown areas in the middle and at the edges.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Toxins produced by the fungus affect leaves, and on some hosts it may kill branches or entire trees. Diagnosis can be confirmed by cutting through a branch that is at least 2.5cm (1in) in diameter, wetting the cut surface and checking it for a brown stain in the wood.
                        </li>

                            Symptom expression depends upon how much of the root or crown tissues are affected and how quickly they are destroyed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Generally, crown rots advance rapidly and trees collapse and die soon after the first warm weather of spring. Leaves of such trees wilt, dry, and remain attached to the tree. Chronic infections, usually of the roots, cause reduction in growth and early senescence and leaf fall.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            These trees may be unthrifty for several years before succumbing to the disease. Phytophthora infections typically kill young trees because their root systems and crown areas are small compared to those of mature trees.

                        <li>
                            First symptoms of infection appear as small red spots on young leaves which enlarge and become purple with a tan-white center.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The spots then drop out of the leaf blade to leave a “shothole.” Severe leaf infections produce numerous holes and give the affected leaves a very tattered appearance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fruit infections begin as purple-red spots on the fruit skin as early as shuck-split and may occur as late as at harvest.
