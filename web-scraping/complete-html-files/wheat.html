                            Powdery mildew can easily be diagnosed by the white, powdery patches that form on the upper surface of leaves and stem.

                        <li>
                            It is a seed borne disease; infection occurs during Loose Smut flowering through wind-borne spores.

                        <li>
                            The infection remains dormant inside the otherwise healthy looking seed but the plants grown from such seeds bear infected inflorescence.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At this time, infected heads emerge earlier than normal heads. The entire inflorescence is commonly affected and appears as a mass of olive-black spores, initially covered by a thin gray membrane.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the membrane ruptures, the head appears powdery.

                        <li>
                            Primary infection occurs by sowing infected seeds.

                            As lesions mature, the centers often turn a light brown to tan color, surrounded by an irregular dark brown ring (21 on leaf; 22 on spike).

                            Primary infections tend to be on the lower leaves, beginning as chlorotic flecks or spots. These infection sites enlarge, turn dark brown, and often coalesce. When the disease is severe, affected leaves or leaf sheaths may die prematurely.

                            This symptom is seen when ears become infected during the early flowering stages. Later infections may result in infection of the grain but without obvious bleaching of the ears.

                        <li>
                            Fusarium lesions often begin in the leaf sheath at the stem base where crown roots split the leaf sheath when emerging. This infection can then spread up the leaf sheath causing long dark brown streaks at the stem base

                        <li>
                            The ear blight phase of the disease can cause yield loss but is most important as it can result in mycotoxin production in the grain.
