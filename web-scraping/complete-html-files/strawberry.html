                    <p>
                        Leaf spot is one of the most common diseases of strawberries, occurring worldwide in most cultivars.

                        <li>
                            Initially, small, deep purple, round to irregularly shaped spots appear on the upper leaf surface

                            These enlarge to between 3â€“6 mm in diameter. They retain a dark red margin, but the centers turn brown, then grey and finally white. Spots may join and kill the leaf
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The fungi also attacks the petioles, stolons, fruit stalks and fruit as shallow black spots.

                    <p>
                        This disease occurs on a wide range of flowers, vegetables and fruit, including strawberries.

                        <li>
                            Flowers and fruit stalks infected during flowering die rapidly. Green and ripe fruit develop brown rot

                            The rot may start on any portion of the fruit, but is found most frequently on the calyx end or on the sides of fruit touching other rotten fruit

                            The fungi over-winters on plant debris and infects flower parts, after which it either rots the fruit or remains inactive until the fruit ripens further. Spores, which are produced continuously throughout the fruiting season, germinate to infect plants

                            Red stele affected plants become stunted and wilt in dry weather.

                            The symptom that helps to identify red stele is the brick red discoloration in the center (stele) of live white roots.

                        <li>
                            The red color may extend the length of the root, or it may show up for only a short distance above the dead root tip.

                        <li>
                            This symptom is obvious only during winter and spring.

                        <li>
                            Infected plants usually die by June or July.

                            Growth of the plants will slow down and they will become dull bluish green. In spring the plants will convalesce somewhat.

                        <li>
                            An affected plant will form no or only few flowers.

                    <p>
                        The disease affects all cultivated strawberries worldwide. No variety is resistant, but each differs in susceptibility.

                        <li>
                            An early symptom of the disease is upward curling of the leaf margins.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is followed by irregular, purple blotching on the upper leaf surfaces, often along major veins. The leaves feel brittle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This disease does not produce the masses of greyish white spores typical of powdery mildew on other crops.
