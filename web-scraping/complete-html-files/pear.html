                        <li>
                            Affected leaves become twisted or puckered and have black, circular spots on their upper surface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On the under surface of leaves, the spots are velvety and may coalesce to cover the whole leaf surface. Severely affected leaves may turn yellow and drop.

                        <li>
                            Scab can also infect flower stems and cause flowers to drop.

                            The lesions later become sunken and brown and may have spores around their margins.

                            Infected fruit become distorted and may crack, allowing entry of secondary organisms.

                            The fungus overwinters in dead infected leaves and fruit on the ground, and less commonly on infected shoots on the tree. In spring around the time of bud burst air borne spores are released which land on young leaves, blossom or fruitlets infecting them. Once these primary infections are established they in turn release more spores which are 47 spread by wind or rain splash to young leaves elsewhere giving rise to secondary infections.

                            Galls are usually restricted to the roots, lower stems and lower branches of infected plants. In some cases, however, crown gall may occur in the upper branches. Galls are somewhat spherical, lumpy and rough, varying in size from 1/2 inch to several inches in diameter.

                            In fruit trees, the base of the trunk at soil level can show signs of a dark, wet rot, especially if kept moist by weeds or wet weather.

                        <li>
                            Most infections start at the junction of a lateral root with the trunk

                            Dark streaks often occur near the cambium and extend beyond the canker margin. If a canker enlarges for several years, only the marginal areas show the typical color and texture of newly killed tissue.

                            The development of the canker is rapid, horizontally and vertically. The ultimate effect of collar rot is to girdle the affected limb, roots, or trunk, resulting in the death of that organ or of the entire tree.

Sudden tree collapse can result from tissue damage at the graft union on highly susceptible rootstocks such as Pyrus serotina or P. ussuriensis, but slow decline of trees is more common.

                            The phytoplasma organism that causes pear decline is carried by pear psylla. Psylla transmits the disease when it feeds on the pear foliage. The expression of disease depends on rootstock susceptibility, tree vigor, and psylla numbers. The organism apparently does not multiply in pear trees as well as it does in pear psylla.
