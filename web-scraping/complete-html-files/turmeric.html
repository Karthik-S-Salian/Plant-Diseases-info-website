                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The disease is soil-borne and rhizomes borne and occurs with the onset of monsoon. This disease mostly occurs during the months of June to September.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The infection starts at the collar region of the pseudostem and progresses upwards as well as downwards.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The collar region of the affected pseudostem becomes water soaked and the rotting spreads to the rhizome resulting in soft rot.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At a later stage root infection is also noticed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Foliar symptoms appear as light yellowing of the tips of lower leaves which gradually spreads to the leaf blades.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In early stages of the disease, the middle portion of the leaves remain green while the margins become yellow.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Later, the yellowing spreads to all leaves of the plant from the lower region upwards and is followed by drooping, withering and drying of pseudostems.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        Survival and spread

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The disease is soil-borne. The fungus multiplies with buildup of soil moisture with the onset of south west monsoon.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The fungus can survive in two ways: (a) in diseased rhizomes kept for sowing and (b) through resting structures like chlamydospores and oospores that reach the soil from infected rhizomes.

                        <li>
                            Younger sprouts are the most susceptible to the pathogen. Nematode infestation aggravates rhizome rot disease.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Temperature above 30° C and high soil moisture are the important predisposing factors favouring the disease.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Water logging in the field due to poor drainage increases the intensity of the disease.

                        <li>
                            Later, spots may coalesce and form an irregular patch covering almost the whole leaf.

                        <li>
                            The centre of spots contains fruit head shaped fruiting structures.

                            The disease causes root rot and rhizome rot resulting in typical dry rot of rhizomes from October onwards.

                            Foliar yellowing and drying up of foliage which are the normal symptoms of maturity of the crop during October - November would be indistinguishable from the symptoms of the disease affected clumps.
