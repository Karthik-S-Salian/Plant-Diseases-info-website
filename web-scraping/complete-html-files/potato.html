                    </h4>
                    <img alt="Bacterial wilt" src="https://static.vikaspedia.in/media/images_en/agriculture/crop-production/integrated-pest-managment/ipm-for-vegetables/ipm-strategies-for-potato/Wiltimg.jpg"/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In addition to the potato, the pathogen also damages plants such as chili, tomato, tobacco and egg plant, as well as several species of weeds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The symptoms of bacterial wilt infection can be seen on all parts of infected plants.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Infected plant begins to wilt, starting from the tips of the leaves or where the stems branch out, and then spreading to all parts of the plant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Leaves become yellow at their bases, then the whole plant wilts and dies. When stems are cut a brown colored ring will be visible.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When a tuber is cut in half, black or brown rings will, however, be visible. If left for a while or squeezed, these rings will exude a thick white fluid.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A further symptom is fluid coming out of tuber eyes. This can be signified by soil sticking to tuber eyes when crops are harvested. Serious infection causes tubers to rot.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            Bacterial wilt pathogen can survive in soil (without a host for several seasons), water, seed tubers, potato plant remnants.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The disease can spread from field to field or from plant to plant within field via infected seed, air, water, soil, farming tools, livestock and people.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The disease spread rapidly in the warmer temperatures in storage areas. Infected seed can also be a source of the disease in the field.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This disease damages leaves, stems and tubers. Affected leaves appear blistered as if scalded by hot water and eventually rot and dry out.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When drying out, leaves turn brown or black in color. When infections are still active, spots appear on the underside of leaves blanketed in what looks like flour.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Affected stems begin to blacken from their tips, and eventually dry out.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Severe infections cause all foliage to rot, dry out and fall to the ground, stems to dry out and plants to die.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Affected tubers display dry brown-colored spots on their skins and flesh. This disease acts very quickly. If it is not controlled, infected plants will die within two or three days.

                        <li>
                            This is a common disease of potato occurring on the foliage at any stage of the growth and causes characteristic leaf spots and blight.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Normally the disease symptoms become apparent during tuber bulking stage and develop leading to the harvest.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The early blight is first observed on the plants as small, black lesions mostly on the older foliage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Spots enlarge, and by the time they are one-fourth inch in diameter or larger, concentric rings in a bull's eye pattern can be seen in the center of the diseased area.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow. If high temperature and humidity occur at this time, much of the foliage is killed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves, sometimes girdling the plant if they occur near the soil line.

                            Symptoms of common potato scab are quite variable and are manifested on the surface of the potato tuber. The disease forms several types of cork-like lesions including surface.

                        <li>
                            Damaged tubers have rough, cracked skin, with scab-like spots. Severe infections leave potato skins covered with rough black welts.

                        <li>
                            Initial infections result in superficial reddish-brown spots on the surface of tubers. As the tubers grow, lesions expand, becoming corky and necrotic.

                            Potato virus Y (PVY ) is a Potyvirus, causes stipple streak. The necrotic strain generally causes mild foliage symptoms, but necrosis in the leaves of susceptible potato varieties.

                            Potato virus X (PVX) is the type member of the Potyvirus family of plant viruses. Plants often do not exhibit symptoms, but the virus can cause symptoms of chlorosis, mosaic, decreased leaf size, and necrotic lesions in tubers.

                        <li>
                            PVX can interact with PVY and PVS to cause more severe symptoms and yield loss than either virus alone. The source of this virus is infected tubers.

                            Black heart occurs primarily in storage when the tubers do not receive enough oxygen.

                            Blackening of the tuber center follows acute oxygen deficiency associated with either low temperature in confined storage or high field soil temperatures

                            The tissue dies from the inside out and turns jet black. Smell is absent.
