                        <li>
                            Characteristic symptom is rotting and extensive shedding of the immature nuts which lie scattered near the base of the tree.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Initial symptoms appear as dark green/ yellowish water-soaked lesions on the nut surface near the perianth (calyx).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The infected nuts lose their natural green lusture, quality and hence have a low market value.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The lesions on the fruits gradually spread covering the whole surface before or after shedding which consequently rot.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            White mycelial mass envelopes on entire surface of the fallen nuts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As the disease advances the fruit stalks and the axis of the inflorescence rot and dry, sometimes covered with white mycelial mats.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Infected nuts are lighter in weight and possess large vacuoles.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When infection occurs later in the season, it leads to rotting and drying up of nuts without shedding (known as ‘Dry Mahali’).

                            The fruit bunches infected towards the end of rainy season may remain mummified on the palm and such nuts provide inoculum for bud rot or crown rot or the recurrence of fruit rot in the next season.

                            The severity, persistence and spread of fruit rot are related to the pattern of rain. The disease appears usually 15 to 20 days after the onset of regular monsoon rains and may continue up to the end of the rainy season.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Continuous heavy rainfall coupled with low temperature (20 to 23 °C), high relative humidity 90%) and intermittent rain and sunshine hours favour the outbreak of fruit rot

                        <li>
                            The female flowers of the infected rachis shed and the whole inflorescence shows ‘die back’ symptom.
