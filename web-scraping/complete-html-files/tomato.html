                            Damping off of tomato occurs in two stages, i.e. the pre-emergence and the post-emergence phase.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the pre-emergence the phase the seedlings are killed just before they reach the soil surface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The young radical and the plumule are killed and there is complete rotting of the seedlings.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The post-emergence phase is characterized by the infection of the young, juvenile tissues of the collar at the ground level.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The infected tissues become soft and water soaked. The seedlings topple over or collapse.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            High humidity, high soil moisture, cloudiness and low temperatures below 24° C for few days are ideal for infection and development of disease.

                        <li>
                            Crowded seedlings, dampness due to high rainfall, poor drainage and excess of soil solutes hamper plant growth and increase the pathogenic damping-off.

                            Tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow. If high temperature and humidity occur at this time, much of the foliage is killed.

                            Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves, sometimes girdling the plant if they occur near the soil line.

                            Transplants showing infection by the late blight fungus often die when set in the field. The fungus also infects the fruit, generally through the calyx or stem attachment.

                            Primary:  The fungus spends the winter in infected plant debris in or on the soil where it can survive at least one and perhaps several years. It can also be seed borne.

                            Moist weather and splattering rains are conducive to disease development. Most outbreaks of the disease can be traced back to heavy rainstorms that occur in the area.

                        <li>
                            Infected leaves show small, brown, water soaked, circular spots surrounded with yellowish halo.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On older plants the leaflet infection is mostly on older leaves and may cause serious defoliation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The most striking symptoms are on the green fruit. Small, water-soaked spots first appear which later become raised and enlarge until they are one-eighth to one-fourth inch in diameter.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Centers of these lesions become irregular, light brown and slightly sunken with a rough, scabby surface.

                        <li>
                            Ripe fruits are not susceptible to the disease. Surface of the seed becomes contaminated with the bacteria, remaining on the seed surface for some time.
