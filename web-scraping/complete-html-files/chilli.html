                            Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves, sometimes girdling the plant if they occur near the soil line.

                            Transplants showing infection by the late blight fungus often die when set in the field. The fungus also infects the fruit, generally through the calyx or stem attachment.

                        <li>
                            Lesions attain considerable size, usually involving nearly the entire fruit; concentric rings are also present on the fruit.

                            Primary  : The fungus spends the winter in infected plant debris in or on the soil where it can survive at least one and perhaps several years. It can also be seed borne.

                        <li>
                            Secondary : The spores are transported by water, wind, insects, other animals including man, and machinery. Once the initial infections have occurred, they become the most important source of new spore production and are responsible for rapid disease spread.

                            The first symptom of the disease is clearing of the veinlets and chlorosis of the leaves.

                            The younger leaves may die in succession and the entire may wilt and die in a course of few days. Soon the petiole and the leaves droop and wilt.

                            In young plants, symptom consists of clearing of veinlet and dropping of petioles. In field, yellowing of the lower leaves first and affected leaflets wilt and die.

                            The symptoms continue in subsequent leaves. At later stage, browning of vascular system occurs. Plants become stunted and die.
