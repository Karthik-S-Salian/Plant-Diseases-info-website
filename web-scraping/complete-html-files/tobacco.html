                            Damping off of tobacco occurs in two stages, i.e. the pre-emergence and the post-emergence phase.

                        <li>
                            In the pre-emergence the phase the seedlings are killed just before they reach the soil surface.

                        <li>
                            The young radical and the plumule are killed and there is complete rotting of the seedlings.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The post-emergence phase is characterized by the infection of the young, juvenile tissues of the collar at the ground level.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The infected tissues become soft and water soaked. The seedlings topple over or collapse.

                            High humidity, high soil moisture, cloudiness and low temperatures below 24Â°C for few days are ideal for infection and development of disease.

                            Crowded seedlings, dampness due to high rainfall, poor drainage and excess of soil solutes hamper plant growth and increase the pathogenic damping-off.

                            Dead and dying vines are usually present in a roughly circular pattern in the vineyard. The viruses are introduced into vineyards with infected planting stock or by dispersal of seed from infected weeds. The virus is then spread by dagger nematodes feeding on roots of infected plants.
