                        Phyllosticta leaf spot symptoms range from a few round spots or lesions. It may cause early loss of leaves in case of severe infestation and can debilitate the tree. The irregular, round, yellowish brown lesions are produced on leaves. Under the favourable conditions, tiny black fruiting bodies of the pathogen are produced, usually they form a circle. The center of these spots is dead tissue that easily breaks away leaving a hole.

Its hind wings have a brick red oval patch near the anal margin and there is no tail like extension behind though common in Papilionidae. Papilio polytes males are black and females vary in form. Papilio helenus has black wings with three white distal spots.

                        Citrus psyllids are mottled brown insects that feed directly on the  leaf of the curry leaf tree. This causes damage to the leaves and stems, and can also introduce bacteria to the tree. Symptoms include twisted and curling leaves, and dieback of shoots.

                        Scales damage plants by sucking out plant sap as a result leaves to yellow and wilt. While a few scales will not damage a curry tree, this insect reproduces rapidly and a small population can quickly become an infestation. Close monitoring of your curry tree can also help to catch scale problems before they become infestations.

                        Citrus mealy bugs are soft pinkish-white insects with a waxy appearance. Mealy bugs are softbodied, wingless insects that grow between 1/20 and 1/5 inch long. Mealy bugs lay large clusters of several hundred eggs on the surface of a leaf, which then hatch into yellow nymphs, which feed on plant sap.

                        In addition to causing leaves to shrivel, large infestations of citrus mealybugs can cause a tree’s fruit to drop prematurely. Mealybugs usually gather in large numbers, causing premature leaf drop and twig dieback when they feed. Like psyllids, they secrete honeydew, which attracts black sooty mold.

                        Aphids suck the juices from a plant, causing the leaves to mottle and curl, and can also introduce mold fungus. Aphids tend to feed in dense clusters and are slow to react when disturbed.

                    <p>
                        Two-spotted mites reproduce sexually, and the females lay eggs on buds, leaves, twigs, stems and trunks. The eggs, which are laid in vast numbers, hatch to produce nymphs which grow through a succession of moults. The first stage nymphs are six-legged; the subsequent stage produces nymphs with a full complement of eight legs. Two-spotted mites overwinter in the soil. Generation time will vary according to temperature, but in warm conditions this time can be as short as four days.
