                            Most of the rot found in mature fruit comes from the infection of young fruit.

                            Fruit rot of litchi has been a serious problem. Litchi is host to a range of post-harvest pathogens, often with quite different modes of infection.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Several fungi have been found to be associated with diseases
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Usually large water soaked lesions appear on the surface of fruits.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Initially the disease symptoms are perceptible on injured portion of the fruits.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            With the advance of the disease the decayed areas get depressed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The rot gradually penetrates deep into the pulp.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ultimately rind of infected fruits cracks off exposing the pulp which subsequently is covered with thick Cottony mycelium.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Such affected fruits emit an odour of fermentation.

                            A slow decline and a sudden death of plant have been recorded in litchi. It can affect the whole tree or just one or two branches.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The symptoms include a sudden branch wilt that is followed by the decline of new growth on the affected branch over a period. In other situations, the tips die without wilting.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The tree or branch may recover temporarily, but subsequently dies. Parts of the tree flush and grow, while other sections die.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In some parts of litchi belt, trees are killed by the root rot.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            One side of the treeâ€™s crown may be perfectly sound and the other totally necrosis.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Leaf shed never occurs (it does in the case of a nematode attack) and the internal parts of the roots are characteristically red in colour
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            No method has been found to save the tree once it has become infected.
