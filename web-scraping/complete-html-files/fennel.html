                            Collar portion of the affected plants start decaying and the plants turn to yellow colour & die later on.

                        <li>
                            Symptoms consist of seed decay and brown to reddish lesions on seedling stems and roots just below the soil line.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            These reddish brown lesions may become sunken and girdle the stems and kill the plant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Plants may often appear stunted and unthrifty and will die.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Often the stand will appear uneven because of stunted plants.

                        <li>
                            Disease is often found in patches in fields.

                            On older plants, the pathogen causes a reddish brown dry cortical root rot that may extend into the base of the stem.
