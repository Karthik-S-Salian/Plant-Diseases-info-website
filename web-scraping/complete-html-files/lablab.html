                            The stems, leaves and fruits of bean plants can be infected by either disease. Rain and damp weather favour disease development.

                            Light greenish-yellow circles that look like halos form around a brown spot or lesion on the plant. With age, the lesions may join together as the leaf turns yellow and slowly dies. Stem lesions appear as long, reddish spots.

                            Common blight infected pods do not have the greenish-yellow halo around the infected spot or lesion. Common blight occurs mostly during warm weather.

                            Symptoms may appear after soil-borne mycelia or sclerotia germinate and infect seedling stems near the soil line at the base of developing cotyledons.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The fungus produced black, sunken, cankers which have a sharp margin and often contain concentric rings.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The plant’s growing tip may be killed or the stem broken where it is weakened by the canker. Infection may continue into the hypocotyl and root region or the primary leaf petioles.

                        <li>
                            Older seedling and plant infections may cause stunting, leaf chlorosis, premature defoliation, and plant death [Schwartz, 1989].

                            M. phaseolina survives as microsclerotia in the soil and on infected plant debris.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The microsclerotia serve as the primary source of inoculum.

                            Wind-borne conidia cause secondary spread.

                            Seeds may also carry the fungus in the seed coat.
