                Coffee leaf rust

            <h4>
                Disease symptoms
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Infection occurs on the coffee leaves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first observable symptoms are small, pale yellow spots on the upper surface of the leaves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As these spots gradually increase in diameter, mass of orange urediniospores (= uredospores) appear on the undersurface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fungus sporulates through the stomata rather than breaking through the epidermis as most rusts do, so it does not form the pustules typical of many rusts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The powdery lesions on the underside of the leaves can be orange-yellow to red-orange in color, and this colour expression has considerable variation from one region to another.
                </li>
            </ul>

                Survival and spread
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Hemileia vastatrix survives primarily as mycelium in the living tissues of the host, and since infected leaves drop prematurely; this effectively removes a huge amount of potential inoculum from the epidemic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    But a few green leaves always persist through the dry season, and dry urediniospores can survive about 6 weeks, so there is always some viable inoculum to infect the newly formed leaves at the start of the next rainy season.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                Favourable conditions
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Rain or dew, high humidity. The whole process of infection requires about 24 to 48 hours of continuous free moisture, so while heavy dew is enough to stimulate urediniospore germination, infection usually occurs only during the rainy season.
