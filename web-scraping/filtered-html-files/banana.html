                    The skin of the fruit turns black and shrivels and becomes covered with characteristic pink acervuli. Finally the whole finger is affected. Later the disease spreads and affects the whole bunch.

                    The virus is transmitted mostly through infected planting materials, though mealy bugs (Planococcus citri) and more probably Saccharicoccus sacchari are also believed to transmit it. Shoot tip culture does not eliminate it from vegetatively propagated materials.

                    The disease manifests itself in all stages of crop growth.

                    Due to repeated use of suckers from infected plants the disease spreads and resulting in the gradual decrease in yield and quality.

                    The disease is known to occur in all banana-growing states.

                    Light yellow streaks run parallel to leaf veins giving the leaf a striped appearance.

                    The streaks run usually from mid rib to edge of the blade.
