                <li>
                    It is the most destructive disease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dark necrotic lesions 2-5 mm in diameter are formed first on hypocotyls and cotyledons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In mature plants, small brown to dark brown concentric spots of 1-2 mm appear on leaves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Symptoms also appear on stem and severely infected plant gets blighted.

                <li>
                    Brown discolouration appears on the stem, dark brown spots with concentric rings up to 1 cm in diameter appear on the leaves which later develop into large lesions.

                <li>
                    Seeds also may be affected. Dark sunken lesions are produced on the testa. It may rot and damping off of seedlings occur.
