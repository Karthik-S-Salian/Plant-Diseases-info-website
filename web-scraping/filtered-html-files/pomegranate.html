                <li>
                    Appearance of one to several small water soaked, dark colored irregular spots on leaves resulting in premature defoliation under severe cases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The pathogen also infects stem and branches causing girdling and cracking symptoms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spots on fruits were dark brown irregular slightly raised with oily appearance, which split open with L-shaped cracks under severe cases.

                    Primary source of inoculum is Infected cuttings

                    The increase in day temperature (38.6°C) and afternoon relative humidity of 30.4% along with cloudy weather and intermittent rainfall favored the disease initiation and further spread of the disease.
