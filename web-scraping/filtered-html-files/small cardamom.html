            <ul>
                <li>
                    The first visible symptom appears on the youngest leaf of the affected tiller as spindle shaped slender chlorotic flecks measuring 2-5 mm in length.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Later these flecks develop into pale green discontinuous stripes. The stripes run parallel to the vein from the midrib to leaf margin.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All the subsequently emerging new leaves show characteristic mosaic symptoms with chlorotic and green stripes. As the leaf matures, the mosaic symptoms are more or less masked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Disease is systemic in nature and it gradually spreads to all the tillers in a clump.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Younger plants express symptoms earlier than grown up clumps. Infected clumps are stunted and smaller in size with a few slender tillers and shorter panicles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Katte infected plants continue to survive for many years and serve as sources of inoculum.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the plants are infected in the seedling stage or the same year of planting the loss will be total. In bearing clumps, the loss will be upto 68% in three years after infection (the loss will be even more at later stages).

                    The characteristic symptoms are continuous or discontinuous intraveinal clearing, stunting, rosetting, loosening of leaf sheath, shredding of leaves and clear mottling on stem.
