                    The younger leaves may die in succession and the entire may wilt and die in a course of few days.

                <li>
                    Soon the petiole and the leaves droop and wilt.

                <li>
                    In young plants, symptom consists of clearing of veinlet and dropping of petioles.

                <li>
                    The symptoms continue in subsequent leaves.

                    At later stage, browning of vascular system occurs.
