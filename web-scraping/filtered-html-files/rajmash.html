            <ul>
                <li>
                    Symptoms of anthracnose can appear on any plant part. Pale brown sunken spots may appear on the cotyledons of infected seedlings.Spots may spread to the hypocotyle, which if girdled, kill the seedlings. Lesions on leaves are dark brown.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They are restricted to the veins on lower leaf surface. On stems, lesions are elongated and sunken.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the pods, the fungus produces black, sunken lesions. These lesions penetrate deep into the pods and may cause shrivelling of the young pods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Infected seed become discoloured changing to yellow through brown to black. In damp weather, the centres of anthracnose lesions become covered with a pink spore mass.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The disease is seed-borne and pathogen can also survive in soil. Secondary disease cycles continue until the weather remains favorable.

                    Frequent showers, heavy dews, temperatures of 20 -30oC, and overcrowding of plants favor the spread and development of anthracnose.

                    Seedlings fail to emerge after planting when the seeds rot in the soil or young seedlings may be stunted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plants are usually affected slightly above or below the soil line with a watery soft rot. Leaves turn yellow and roots get rotten.

                <li>
                    Causal organisms survive in soil and seed as resting mycelia or sclerotia for long period. These organisms often survive as saprophytes, living on dead plant material, or as dormant mycelia or spores. Root exudates from germinating seedlings or growing roots stimulate the dormant fungi to become active.

                    Diseases are prevalent under cool wet conditions that keep the soil temperatures below 13°C.

                    root rot is most damaging when cool, wet conditions in the spring are followed by hot (25 -29°C), dry conditions.
