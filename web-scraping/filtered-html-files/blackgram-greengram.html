            <ul>
                <li>
                    Moist weather and splattering rains are conducive to disease development. Most outbreaks of the disease can be traced back to heavy rainstorms that occur in the area.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Infected leaves show small, brown, water soaked, circular spots surrounded with yellowish halo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On older plants the leaflet infection is mostly on older leaves and may cause serious defoliation. The most striking symptoms are on the green fruit. Small water-soaked spots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    First appear which later become raised and enlarge until they are one-eighth to one-fourth inch in diameter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Centres of these lesions become irregular, light brown and slightly sunken with a rough, scabby surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ripe fruits are not susceptible to the disease. Surface of the seed becomes contaminated with the bacteria, remaining on the seed surface for some time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The organism survives in alternate hosts, on volunteer black gram plants and on infected plant debris.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The fungus is soil borne on diseased plant debris and it survives only on the tissues which it colonizes as a parasite.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fungus spreads abort 3 m through the soil in one season, apparently along roots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fungus was found to survive in infected plant stubble for 2.5 in vertisols and 3 years in alfisols.

            <h4>
                Disease symptoms
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is a common disease of blackgram occurring on the foliage at any stage of the growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fungus attacks the foliage causing characteristic leaf spots and blight. Early blight is first observed on the plants as small, black lesions mostly on the older foliage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spots enlarge, and by the time they are one-fourth inch in diameter or larger, concentric rings in a bull’s eye pattern can be seen in the center of the diseased area.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow. If high temperature and humidity occur at this time, much of the foliage is killed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves, sometimes girdling the plant if they occur near the soil line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transplants showing infection by the late blight fungus often die when set in the field. The fungus also infects the fruit, generally through the calyx or stem attachment. Lesions attain considerable size, usually involving nearly the entire fruit; concentric rings are also present on the fruit.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Initially mild scattered yellow spots appear on young leaves
                </li>
                <li>
                    The next trifoliate leaves emerging from the growing apex show irregular yellow and green patches alternating with each other
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spots gradually increase in size and ultimately some leaves turn completely yellow
                </li>
                <li>
                    Infected leaves also show necrotic symptoms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Diseased plants are stunted, mature late and produce very few flowers and pods
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pods of infected plants are reduced in size and turn yellow in colour.

                <li>
                    The disease is transmitted in semi persistent manner by aphid Aphis gossypii.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Aphids are more active in warm summer conditions and increase in their population leads to increased spread of the viruses.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The symptoms appear on youngest leaves as chlorosis around some lateral veins and its branches near the margin
                </li>
                <li>
                    The leaves show curling of margin downwards
                </li>
                <li>
                    The veins show reddish brown discoloration on the under surface which also extends to the petiole
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plants showing symptoms within 5 weeks after sowing invariably remain stunted and majority of these die due to top necrosis within a week or two.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Virus is transmitted by Henosepilachnadodeca stigma. The disease develops in the fields mainly through seed or rubbing of diseased leaves
