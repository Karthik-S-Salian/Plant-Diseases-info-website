                <li>
                    The late stage:  Enlarged spots and become browning and dry. Close inspection of the underside of the leaf often reveals the purple growth of the fungus.

                <li>
                    If disease development is extensive, leaves appear curled and distorted and may take on a blighted effect as a result of numerous infection sites.

                    Visual signs of fungal growth are generally absent from the spots; hence this symptoms is readily differentiated from foliar diseases in which purple growth (downy mildew), green spores ( Cladosporium leaf spot), or acervuli (anthracnose) develop within circular lesions.

                Damping off and root rot

                Disease symptoms
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Symptoms of damping-off and root rot consist of poor seed germination, pre-emergence death of seedlings, post emergence death of newly emerged seedlings, stunted plants, yellowed lower leaves, general poor growth, wilting, and eventual collapse and death of older plants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roots of infected plants can appear water-soaked or brown to black in color. The upper taproot may be girdled by a necrotic lesion, or the tip of the taproot may be necrotic. In severe cases, nearly all roots may be girdled or rotted off.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Severity is influenced by cultivar, soil texture, irrigation, and pathogen populations. Severe damping- off is associated with clay or poorly draining soils with a history of frequent spinach production. While all stages of spinach can be infected by root rot organisms, newly emerging plants and young seedlings are very susceptible.

                <li>
                    The fungus survives in soil and inoculum present in the soil is source of primary infection. Secondary infection occurs by means of conidia through rain splash or wind.

                    High humidity, high soil moisture, cloudiness and low temperatures below 24°C for few days are ideal for infection and development of disease.

                <li>
                    Crowded seedlings, dampness due to high rainfall, poor drainage and excess of soil solutes hamper plant growth and increase the pathogenic damping-off.
