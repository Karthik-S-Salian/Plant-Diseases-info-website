                <li>
                    The characteristic symptom of the disease is the white superficial powdery fungal growth on leaves, stalks of panicles, flowers and young fruits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The affected flowers and fruits drop pre-maturely reducing the crop load considerably or might even prevent the fruit set.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fungus parasitizes young tissues of all parts of the inflorescence, leaves and fruits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Young leaves are attacked on both the sides but it is more conspicuous on the grower surface. Often these patches coalesce and occupy larger areas turning into purplish brown in colour

                    The powdery mildew fungus overwinters in dormant buds. When conditions are favorable for growth of the fungus in spring, spores are produced, released, and cause new infections. Secondary spread of the disease can occur if spores are produced in these new infections

                    The disease causes serious losses to young shoots, flowers and fruits It is also affects fruits during storage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The disease produces leaf spot, blossom blight, wither tip, twig blight and fruit rot symptoms. Tender shoots and foliage are easily affected which ultimately cause „die back‟ of young branches. Older twigs may also be infected through wounds which in severe cases may be fatal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Depending on the prevailing weather conditions blossom blight may vary in severity from slight to a heavy infection of the panicles. Black spots develop on panicles as well as on fruits. Severe infection destroys the entire inflorescence resulting in no setting of fruits. Young infected fruits develop black spots, shrivel and drop off.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fruits infected at mature stage carry the fungus into storage and cause considerable loss during storage, transit and marketing.

                <li>
                    Red rust disease, caused by an alga, has been observed in mango growing areas. The algal attack causes reduction in photosynthetic activity and defoliation of leaves thereby lowering vitality of the host plant.

                <li>
                    The disease can easily be recognized by the rusty red spots mainly on leaves and sometimes on petioles and bark of young twigs and is epiphytic in nature.

                <li>
                    The spots are greenish grey in colour and velvety in texture. Later, they turn reddish brown. The circular and slightly elevated spots sometimes coalesce to form larger and irregular spots. The disease is more common in closely planted orchards.

                <li>
                    The disease in the field is recognized by the presence of a black velvety coating, i.e., sooty mould on the leaf surface. In severe cases the trees turn completely black due to the presence of mould over the entire surface of twigs and leaves.

                    The severity of infection depends on the honey dew secretion by the above said insects. Honey dew secretions from insects sticks to the leaf surface and provide necessary medium for fungal growth.

                    Vegetative malformation: Vegetative malformation is pronounced in young seedlings. The affected seedlings develop vegetative growths which are abnormal growth, swollen and have very short internodes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Floral malformation: The flower buds are transformed into vegetative buds and a large number of small leaves and stems, which are characterized by appreciably reduced internodes and give an appearance of witches‟ broom. The flower buds seldom open and remain dull green.

                <li>
                    The disease is mainly spread via infected plant material. Mango malformation disease spreads slowly within affected orchards.

                <li>
                    The mango bud mite, Aceria mangiferae, has been associated with mango malformation disease as wounds from the mites‟ feeding activity are thought to facilitate fungal infection.

                    The disease is characterized by the presence of profuse oozing of gum on the surface of the affected wood, bark of the trunk and also on larger braches but more common on the cracked branches.

                <li>
                    In severe cases, droplets of gum trickle down on stem, bark turn dark brown with longitudinal cracks, rots completely and the tree dries up because of cracking, rotting and girdling effects

                    The scab fungus attack leaves, panicles, blossoms, twigs, bark of stems and mango fruits. Spots are circular, slightly angular, elongated, 2-4 mm in diameter, brown but during rainy season, lesions differ in size, shape and colour.

                <li>
                    Symptoms produced by the disease are very much like those of anthracnose.

                    On young fruits, the infection is grey to grayish brown with dark irregular margins. As the fruit attains in size, spots also enlarge and the centre may become covered with the crack fissure and corky tissues.
