                    Small, pinhole-size spots are initially seen on young leaves less than a month old. As the leaves develop, the spots become transparent, larger, and light brown.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After about 7 days, the lower leaf surface develops blister-like symptoms, with dark green, water-soaked zones surrounding the blisters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Following release of the fungal spores, the blister becomes white and velvety.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Subsequently the blister turns brown, and young infected stems become bent and distorted and may break off or die.

            <ul>

                    The pathogens survive on leaves or stems and in fallen plant host debris.

                <li>
                    Disease is readily spread by the dispersal of spore by wind.

                    Leaves develop lesions that are roughly circular, raised, and purple to reddish-brown. The alga may spread from leaves to branches and fruit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most algal spots develop on the upper leaf surface.

                <li>
                    Older infections become greenish-gray and look like lichen. Cephaleuros usually does not harm the plant.

                    Small, oval, pale yellow-green spots first appear on youngleaves. Often the spots are surrounded by a narrow, yellow zone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As the spots grow and turn brown or gray, concentric rings with scattered, tiny black dots become visible and eventually the dried tissue falls, leading to defoliation. Leaves of any age can be affected.

                <li>
                    The pathogen survives in decay plant debris which is the sourse of primary infection.

                <li>
                    When young twigs of susceptible cultivars are cut and used to root new plants, latent mycelium in the leaf tissue may start to invade nearby cells to form brown spots, and this may lead to death of leaves and twigs.

                    The first symptoms include browning and drooping of affected leaves. As the disease spreads into the shoots, they become dry and die. The entire branch can die from the tip downward.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dying branches often have cankers-shallow, slowly spreading lesions surrounded by a thick area of bark.

                <li>
                    Tea plants of all ages are susceptible to this disease. Affectedbushes occur in patches, usually around old tree stumps, but sometimes isolated bushes are affected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plants become weaker and their leaves begin to turn yellow and finally wilt and defoliate, eventually leading to death of the plant.

                    Scrapping of the bark at the collar region reveals sheets of creamy white mycelia and the wood has a strong mushroom like-smell.
