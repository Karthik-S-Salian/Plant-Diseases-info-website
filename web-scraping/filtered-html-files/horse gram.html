                Disease symptoms:
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Moist weather and splashing rains are conducive to disease development. Most outbreaks of the disease can be traced back to heavy rainstorms that occur in the area.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Infected leaves show small, brown, water soaked, circular spots surrounded with yellowish halo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On older plants, the leaflet infection is mostly on older leaves and may cause serious defoliation. The most striking symptoms are on the green fruit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Small, water-soaked spotsfirst appear which later become raised and enlarge until they are one-eighth to one-fourth inch in diameter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Centres of these lesions become irregular, light brown and slightly sunken with a rough, scabby surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ripe fruits are not susceptible to the disease. Surface of the seed becomes contaminated with the bacteria, remaining on the seed surface for some time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The organism survives in alternate hosts, on volunteer horsegram plants and on infected plant debris.

                Disease symptoms:
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is a common disease of horsegram occurring on the foliage at any stage of the growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The pathogen attacks the foliage causing characteristic leaf spots and blight. Early blight is first observed on the plants as small, black lesions mostly on the older foliage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spots enlarge, and by the time they are one-fourth inch in diameter or larger, concentric rings in a bull's eye pattern can be seen in the center of the diseased area.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow. If high temperature and humidity occur at this time, much of the foliage is killed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves, sometimes girdling the plant if they occur near the soil line.
