                    In severe infection, the entire inflorescences is replaced by short twisted leaves closely arranged on a stem with short internodes, abundant abnormal branches bend down.

                    The fungus attacks young seedling, their stems become water soaked soft and incapable of supporting the seedling which falls over and dies.
                </li>

                    On older seedlings elongated brownish black lesions appear which increase in length and width girdling the stem and plant dies.

                Favourable conditions -
            </h4>
            High soil temperatures and moisture stress conditions favour the development of the pathogen.

            <p>
                Disease can occur at all stages of the plant.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Initial symptom is water soaked spots on leaves and stems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The spots are chestnut brown in the beginning later turn to black.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Premature leaf fall occurs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In humid weather, severity of disease increases, main root is affected, diseased plants are easily pulled out and produce shriveled seeds and gives blighted appearance.

                    Small, dark brown water soaked, round to irregular lesions, with concentric rings, 1-8 mm in diameter appear on the leaves and under excessive atmospheric and soil humidity the spot increases in size and number.

                    The lesions may also appear on the midrib and veins of the leaves.

                    Milder attacks cause only defoliation, in severe cases the plant may die.
