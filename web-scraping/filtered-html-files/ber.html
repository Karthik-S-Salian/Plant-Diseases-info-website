            <ul>
                <li>
                    Phoma fruit rot:  The disease appears on the ripening fruit. The infected fruits remain small and develop slightly depressed, dark brown spots near the stem ends. The lesions become irregular in shape and measure 15-25 mm in diameter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alternaria fruit rot:  Slightly depressed, brown to dark brown, circular lesions appear on the fruit. Sometimes concentric rings are also present on these spots. The smaller spots coalesce to form larger spots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Colletotrichum fruit rot:  The disease appears at the start of ripening of the fruit in the form of small, slightly depressed, light brown, water-soaked lesions. These spots coalesce and enlarge. Under humid conditions, the acervuli are formed in masses on these spots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Trichothecium fruit rot :  The disease is observed during the spring in the form of pink spots on the fruits. The fungus can survive in the soil for a long time. Fruits touching the soil may become infected and develop symptoms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cladosporium fruit rot:  The disease appears near the time of fruit ripening. Injured fruits become infected. The symptoms of the disease start from the tip of the fruit forming light brown to dark brown spots. Later, a greenish fungal growth is also seen on these spots.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The symptoms of the disease are noticed on flowers and newly set fruits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The disease may appear earlier if conditions are favourable. The developing young leaves show a whitish powdery mass, which causes them to shrink and defoliate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The disease also appears in the form of white powdery spots on the surface of the fruits and later covers the whole fruit surface. The spots turn into light brown to dark brown discolouration. The infected area becomes slightly raised and rough.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Affected fruits either drop off prematurely or become corky,cracked, misshapen and remain underdeveloped. Sometimes the whole crop is rendered unmarketable.

                <li>
                    The powdery mildew fungus overwinters in dormant buds. When conditions are favourable for growth of the fungus in spring, spores are produced, released, and cause new infections. Secondary spread of the disease can occur if spores are produced in these new infections

            <ul>

                    The development of powdery mildew is favour by relative humidity around 80-85% and temperature range of 24-26Â°C.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The disease is common in the orchards where mealy bug, scale insect and hopper are not controlled efficiently.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The disease in the field is recognize by the presence of a black velvety coating, i.e., sooty mould on the leaf surface. In severe cases the trees turn completely black due to the presence of mould over the entire surface of twigs and leaves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The severity of infection depends on the honey dew secretion by the above said insects. Honey dew secretions from insects sticks to the leaf surface and provide necessary medium for fungal growth.

Later, it covers the entire lower surface giving a sooty appearance. The leaves show yellowish and brownish discolouration on the upper surface and drop prematurely.

                <li>
                    Cercospora leaf spot:  The disease manifests itself in the form of circular to oval spots, measuring up to 4 mm in diameter, epiphyllous, yellow at first and turning brown surrounded by a darkbrown margin. The spots grow larger and become visible on both sides of the leaves. The infected leaves fall off. Cercospora leaf spot is also found on Chinese jujube, causing leaf yellowing.
