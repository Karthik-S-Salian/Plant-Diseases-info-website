                    Infection begins at blossom-end of the fruit and later spreads on entire fruit surface, affected fruits shrivel and they may cling to the tree or fall down.

                    Necrotic spots of 2-10 mm in diameter appear on unripe fruits which turn into dark brown to black spots. These spots coalesce later and cover entire fruit.

                    Alternaria leaf spot: Small yellowish spots first appear along the leaf margins, which gradually enlarge and turn into brownish patches with concentric rings. Severe infection leads to drying and defoliation. Dark brown-purplish patches appear on the infected fruits andrachis just below its attachment with the shoots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cylindrocladium leaf spot: Upper: dark purple spots about 1 to 2 mm in diameter develop first on the shoulders of the fruit and then spread down the sides. Spots enlarge and then later dry out and crack. Similar in appearance to spotting bug damage, but spots are irregular in shape whereas spotting bug lesions are round, and damage does not extend very far into the fruit.

                    Diseased fruits show symptoms of purplish to black spots or blotches confined to the surface of the fruit and eventually covered with white mycelia and black pycnidia.

                <li>
                    Diplodia rot is distinguished by its dark internal discolouration and the extensive corky rotting produces.
