                    It is characterized by the appearance of water-soaked patches on the stem near the ground level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These patches enlarge rapidly and girdle the stem, causing rotting of the tissues, which then turn dark brown or black. Such affected plants withstand strong wind and topple over and die.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the disease attack is mild, only one side of the stem rots and the plants remain stunted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fruit if formed are shriveled and malformed. Gradually the plant dies.

                    Disease occurs both in field and in storage conditions.

                <li>
                    The spots on fruits first appear as brown superficial discolouration of the skin which develops into circular, slightly sunken areas and 1 to 3 cm in dia.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gradually the lesions coalesce and sparse mycelia growth appears on the margins of the spots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Under humid conditions, an encrustation of salmon pink spores is released.

                <li>
                    Infection at early stages of fruit results in mummification and deformation.

                    The disease is spread through wind-borne conidia.

                <li>
                    Conidia are also spread by rain splashes.

                <li>
                    Severity of the disease on foliage is increased under conditions of excessive moisture. Lesions develop more slowly on the immature fruits than on the mature fruits.

                <li>
                    On upper surfaces, leaves at the infection site show blotches of yellow or pale green usually near vein, surrounded by normally colored tissue.

                    Occasionally, fungus may attack the stem of young seedling when grown under reduced light condition. The spots enlarge and cover the entire leaf area. Severely infected leaves may become chlorotic and distorted before falling. Affected fruits are small in size and malformed.

                <li>
                    Fungus grow superficially on the undersurface of the leaves with drawing nutrients from the cell of leaf surface by specialized absorbing structure known as haustoria.

                <li>
                    The powdery mildew fungus overwinters in dormant buds. When conditions are favorable for growth of the fungus in spring, spores are produced, released, and cause new infections. Secondary spread of the disease can occur if spores are produced in these new infections

                    The development of powdery mildew in papaya is favour by relative humidity around 80-85% and temperature range of 24-26°C.
