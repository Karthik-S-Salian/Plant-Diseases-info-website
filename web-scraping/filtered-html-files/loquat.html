                <li>
                    The first sign is a watery, light tan bacterial ooze that exudes from cankers (small to large areas of dead bark that the pathogen killed during previous seasons) on branches, twigs, or trunks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ooze turns dark after exposure to air, leaving streaks on branches or trunks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, most cankers are small and inconspicuous; thus infections might not be noticed until later in spring when flowers, shoots, and/or young fruit shrivel and blacken.

                <li>
                    The amount of fruit loss depends upon the extent and severity of the disease.

                <li>
                    Splashing rain or insects transmit the bacteria to nearby blossoms or succulent growing shoots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once blossoms are contaminated with the bacteria, honey bees become efficient carriers of the pathogen.
