                    Leaves often twisted, distorted, and stunted.

                    The leaflets have localized mosaic pattern.

                <li>
                    Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) is the carrier of the virus and transmission is through their feeding habits.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The severity of cassava mosaic disease is influenced by environmental factors such as wind, rainfall, plant density and temperature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The viruses are transmitted through infected cuttings and by whitefly and the spread of the virus largely dependent on the vector population

            <p>
                Vector-preferred temperature estimates vary from 27°C to 32°C but generally high temperatures associated with high fecundity, rapid development, and greater longevity.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Cassava root rot diseases are caused by the fungus Phytophthora palmivora in the soil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In poorly drained soils, where there is a prolong wet period, the damage caused by these microorganisms may be greater.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no external symptom. When uproots the tuber only we could see the symptom
                </li>
                <li>
                    The symptom starts as small water soaked brown lesions in tuber , as the disease advances it cover the entire tuber . Finally the tuber will rotten and exhibit foul smell

                    Infected plant debris serve as a primary source of inoculum.
