                    Symptoms of iris yellow spot virus are often seen as a cream, elliptical spots on the leaves. The spots also appear on garlic scapes or flower stalks of garlics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As both infected leaves and scapes age, they can collapse at the site of the spots. The spots may be clear or less obvious. Although the spots may at first be insignificant, the disease has the potential of devastating the whole crop.

                    Field symptoms often appear as one or two wilted leaves in the center of the leaf cluster. These leaves eventually turn pale yellow and dieback from the tip while older and younger leaves maintain a healthy green appearance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During the early stages of this disease, the bulbs may appear healthy except for a softening of the neck tissue. In a longitudinal section, one or more inner scales become watery or cooked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The disease progresses from the top of the infected scale to the base
                </li>
                <li>
                    Eventually, all the internal tissue will rot. Finally, the internal scales dry and the bulb shrivel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Squeezing the base of infected plants causes the rotted inner portion of the bulbs to slide out through the neck, hence the name slippery skin.
