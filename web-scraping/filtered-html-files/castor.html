            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The disease first makes its appearance on both the surfaces of the cotyledonary leaves in the form of roundish patch of dull green colour which soon spreads to the point of attachment causing the leaf to rot and hang down.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                Spots on older leaf

                <li>
                    The infection further spreads to the stem with the result that the seedling is killed either due to the destruction of growing point or by the collapse of stem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The true leaves of seedlings and the very young leaves of older plants may also be affected; but ordinarily not much injury is caused.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The leaf spots turn yellow and then brown and concentric zones of lighter and darker brown colour are formed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The disease spots coalesce at a later stage and cover almost the entire leaf.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The affected leaves shed prematurely. Under moist conditions, a very fi ne whitish haze is found on the under-surface of the leaf spots.

                    All the aerial parts of the plant, i.e., stem, leaves, inflorescence and capsules are liable to be attacked.

                <li>
                    These may appear on any portion of the leaf and are irregular, scattered, and have concentric rings.

                <li>
                    These are brown and later become covered with bluish-green or sooty growth.

                <li>
                    When the attack is severe the spots coalesce and form big patches resulting in premature defoliation of the plant which gradually wilts away.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In one case the capsules, when half mature, wilt suddenly, turn brown and due to collapse of the pedicel the capsules fall or hand down.

                    They are smaller in size and have under-developed and wrinkled seeds with little oil content.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The disease appears as minute black or brown points surrounded by a pale green ring.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These spots are visible on both the surfaces of the leaf.

                <li>
                    As the spots enlarge, the centre turns pale brown and then greyish-white surrounded by a deep brown band which may be narrow and sharp or broad and diff used.

                <li>
                    The fructifications of the fungus appear as tiny black dots in the white centre.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The diseased spots often occur in great numbers scattered over the leaf and are roundish when young but may become irregularly angular when mature.

                <li>
                    When the spots are close together, the intervening leaf tissue withers and large brown patches of dried leaf may result.
