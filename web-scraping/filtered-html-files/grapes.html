                <li>
                    The fungus is an obligate pathogen which can attack all green parts of the vine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Symptoms of this disease are frequently confused with those of powdery mildew. Infected leaves develop pale yellow-green lesions which gradually turn brown. Severely infected leaves often drop prematurely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Infected petioles, tendrils, and shoots often curl, develop a shepherd's crook, and eventually turn brown and die.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Young berries are highly susceptible to infection and are often covered with white fruiting structures of the fungus. Infected older berries of white cultivars may turn dull gray-green, whereas those of black cultivars turn pinkish red.

                    The fungus overwinters mainly in the fallen leaves which are the source of primary infection. Secondary infection occurs by motile zoospores by splashing rain.

                <li>
                    Powdery mildew, caused by the fungus Uncinulanecator, can infect all green tissues of the grapevine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tissues are generally susceptible to infection throughout the growing season.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Diseased leaves appear whitish gray, dusty, or have a powdery white appearance. Petioles, cluster stems, and green shoots often look distorted or stunted. Berries can be infected until their sugar content reaches about 8%.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If infected when young, the epidermis of the berry can split and the berries dry up or rot. When older berries are infected, a netlike pattern often develops on the surface of the berry.

                <li>
                    The powdery mildew fungus overwinters in dormant buds or as specialized structures on the surface of the vines. When conditions are favorable for growth of the fungus in spring, spores are produced, released, and cause new infections. Secondary spread of the disease can occur if spores are produced in these new infections.

                    Anthracnose, caused by the fungus Elsinoe ampelina, is also known as bird’s-eye rot from its appearance on the fruit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The disease appears first as dark red spots on the berry. Later, these spots are circular, sunken, ashy-gray and in late stages these spots are surrounded by a dark margin which gives it the “bird’s-eye rot” appearance. The spots vary in size from 1/4 inch in diameter to about half the fruit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fungus also attacks shoots, tendrils, petioles, leaf veins, and fruit stems. Numerous spots sometimes occur on the young shoots. These spots may unite and girdle the stem, causing death of the tips. Spots on petioles and leaves cause them to curl or become distorted.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    This fungus can infect all green parts of the vine including leaves, tendrils, new shoots, as well as berries. However, mature leaves and ripe fruit are not susceptible. Infections of leaves first appear as red spots on the upper leaf surface in late spring.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These circular spots enlarge and become tan to light brown with distinct, dark borders. Small, pinpoint black fruiting structures of the fungus often develop in the centers of these spots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most serious damage usually occurs on the berries. On the fruit, infections first appear as whitish spots which enlarge to sunken areas with dark borders. Significant infections usually occur when the grape is pea-size or larger. As infection progresses, the fruit becomes black, wrinkled, mummified, and look like raisins. Infected grapes often shatter,leaving only the stem.

                    The fungus overwinters on mummified berries on the soil or in old clusters still hanging in the vines. Secondary infections can occur when additional spores are produced on the newly infected tissues.
