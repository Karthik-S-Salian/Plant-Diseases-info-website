            <ul>
                <li>
                    The infection starts at the collar region of the pseudo stem and progresses upwards as well as downwards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Affected pseudo stem becomes water soaked and the rotting spreads to the rhizome resulting in soft rot. At a later stage root infection is also noticed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Foliar symptoms appear as light yellowing of the tips of lower leaves which gradually spreads to the leaf blades.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In early stages, the middle portion of the leaves remain green while the margins become yellow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The yellowing spreads to all leaves of the plant from the lower region upwards and is followed by drooping, withering and drying of pseudo Stems.

                    The disease is soil-borne.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fungus can survive in two ways: (a) in diseased rhizomes kept for seed, and (b) through resting structures like chlamydo spores and oospores that reach the soil from infected rhizomes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fungus multiplies with buildup of soil moisture with the onset of south west monsoon.

                    Younger sprouts are the most susceptible to the pathogen. Nematode infestation aggravates rhizome rot disease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A high temperature above 30° C and high soil moisture are the important predisposing factors favouring the disease.

                <li>
                    Waterlogging in the field due to poor drainage increases the intensity of the disease.

                <li>
                    The first conspicuous symptom is mild drooping and curling of leaf margins of the lower leaves which spread upwards.

                    Yellowing starts from the lowermost leaves and gradually progresses to the upper leaves.

                    In the advanced stage, severe yellowing and wilting symptoms occurs.
