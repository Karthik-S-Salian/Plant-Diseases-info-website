                <li>
                    The disease can be latent, it can develop unseen for some time and when symptoms fi rst appear, the plant is already seriously infected.

                <li>
                    The first sign of the disease is the development of “pencil lines” of white with yellow borders following the veins on the leaf that lead to necrosis (death) of tissue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The term “scald” for the disease comes from areas of the leaf that loose their color and become a pale green (chlorotic) as they fail to produce chloroplasts.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Several of them may coalesce to cover large areas of the leaf blade, and to cause wilting and drying of the leaves.

                <li>
                    Whitish flakes occur on the lower surface of the leaf, corresponding to the red lesions on the upper surface.

                <li>
                    These flakes are the dry bacterial ooze. When young shoots are affected, shoot or top rot may result. The growing points of the shoot are yellow and later reddish with dark brown stripes on the shoots.

                    Chlorotic Phase: The earliest symptom of Pokkahboeng is a chlorotic condition towards the base of the young leaves and occasionally on the other parts of the leaf blades.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Frequently, a pronounced wrinkling, twisting and shortening of the leaves accompanied the malformation or distortion of the young leaves. The base of the affected leaves is seen often narrower than that of the normal leaves..

                <li>
                    Acute Phase or Top-Rot Phase: The most advanced and serious stage of Pokkahboeng is a top rot phase. The young spindles are killed and the entire top dies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leaf infection sometimes continued to downward and penetrates in the stalk by way of a growing point. In advanced stage of infection, the entire base of the spindle and even growing point showed a malformation of leaves, pronounced wrinkling, twisting and rotting of spindle leaves. Red specks and stripes also developed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Knife-cut Phase (associate with top rot phase): The symptoms of knife-cut stage are observed in association with the acute phase of the disease characterized by one or two or even more transverse cuts in the rind of the stalk /stem in such a uniform manner as if, the tissues are removed with a sharp knife, This is an exaggerated stage of a typical ladder lesion of a Pokkahboeng disease.

                    The earliest symptoms of common rust on the leaves are small, elongated yellowish spots which are visible on both the surfaces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These spots increase in size, mainly in length, and turn red-brown to brown in color. A narrow, pale yellow-green halo develops around the lesions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the common rust is severe, numerous lesions occur on individual leaves giving them an overall brown or rusty appearance. These lesions coalesce to from large, irregular necrotic areas is usually result in premature death of the leaf. In such cases, the number of live leaves per plant can be seriously reduced.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Symptoms of SCYLD are a yellowing of the leaf midrib on the underside of the leaf. The yellowing first appears on leaves 3 to 6 counting down from the top expanding spindle leaf.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Initial symptoms of yellow leaf, with a yellowing of the lower surface of the leaf midrib of leaves 3 to 6 counting from the top expanding spindle leaf.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Yellowing is most prevalent and noticeable in mature cane from October until the end of harvest in March.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The yellowing expands out from the leaf midrib into the leaf blade as the season progresses until a general yellowing of the leaves can be observed from a distance.

                    The virus is transmitted by aphids, Melanaphis sacchari and Rhopalosiphum maidis, in a semi-persistent manner. The virus is also spread by planting infected seed cane.
