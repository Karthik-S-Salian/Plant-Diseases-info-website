                Disease symptoms
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Symptoms can appear 4 to 6 weeks after sowing. The initial visible symptoms are loss of turgidity in leaves, and slight interveinal clearing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The foliage shows slight chlorosis and sometimes becomes bright yellow before wilting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leaves are retained on wilted plants. The initial characteristic internal symptom of wilt is the browning of the xylem vessels from the root system to the stems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The xylem gradually develops black streaks, and brown or dark purple bands appear on the stem surface of partially wilted plants extending upwards from the base.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the bark of such bands is peeled off , browning or blackening of the wood beneath can be seen. in wilt-tolerant genotypes these bands are confined to the basal part of the plant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes, especially in the later stages of crop growth, the branches dry from the top downwards, but symptoms are not seen on the lower portions of the main stem or branches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Small branches on the lower part of the plant also dry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the main stem of such plants is split open, intensive blackening of the xylem can be seen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In humid weather, a pinkish mycelial growth is commonly observed the basal portions of the wilted plants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Partial wilting is usually associated with lateral root infection. Tap root infection results in complete wilting.
                </li>
            </ul>

                Survival and spread

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The fungus is soil borne and survive in the soils. Fungus spreads about 3 m through the soil in one season, apparently along roots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fungus was found to survive in infected plant stubble for 2.5 years Vertisols and 3 years in Alfisols.

                Favourable conditions

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Low soil temperature and increasing plant maturity favours wilt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fungal population is highest at 30% soil water-holding capacity and at the soil temperatures between20 and 30Â° C.

                    The disease first appears in the form of yellow, diff used spots scattered on the leaf lamina, not limited by veins and veinlets.

                <li>
                    Such spots slowly expand and in later stages of disease development, affected leaflets show broad, yellow patches alternating with green colour.

                <li>
                    Sometimes the entire lamina turns yellow.

                <li>
                    Leaf size is conspicuously reduced in early infections.
