                    Most destructive fungal disease that produces both a wet rot symptom on leaves and wilting due to foot rot.

                <li>
                    At first circular, dark brown spots appear which become wet and rot under continuous high humid conditions

                <li>
                    Root system of the affected plant is damaged. Lateral roots are completely destroyed. Disease occurs mostly in patches and the vines wilt and die. In a week's time, 80 to 90 per cent of the vines wilt and die
