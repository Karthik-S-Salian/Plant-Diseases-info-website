                    <li>
                        Rust generally develops late in the summer, and in years when disease is severe, it can cause the trees to defoliate in a matter of a few weeks. If this happens on a regular basis, the overall growth of the trees can be reduced and yields can be affected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another consequence of defoliation is that if it occurs early in the summer, the trees will put out new growth that is then at risk of being damaged by early frosts. On the other hand, if defoliation occurs in the fall, the trees may go dormant earlier than usual, which then protects them from early frosts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Initially, symptoms of fig rust are visible as small, yellowish spots on the upper surface of the leaves. As these spots (or lesions) grow larger, they turn a reddish-brown color but remain relatively smooth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the lower surface of the leaf, the lesions are a reddish-brown color and have a slightly raised, blister-like appearance. Heavily infected leaves often turn yellow or brown, particular y around the edges, and drop prematurely.

                    <li>
                        The fungus mainly survives through teliospores (thick walled, resting spores) on leaves left in the orchard or on the soil surface.

                    <li>
                        The disease spreads by wind-borne uredospores from infected tree.
