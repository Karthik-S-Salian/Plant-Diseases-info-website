            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pre-emergence damping-off:  This results in seed and seedling rot before they emerge out of the soil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Post-emergence damping-off:  The pathogen attacks the collar region of seedlings on the surface of soil. The collar portion rots and ultimately the seedlings collapse and die.

                    The disease is more prevalent during Kharif season/rainy season and causes about 60-75% damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    High soil moisture and moderate temperature along with high humidity leads to the development of the disease.

                    Symptoms of iris yellow spot virus are often seen as a cream, elliptical spots on the leaves. The spots also appear on onion scapes or flower stalks of onions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As both infected leaves and scapes age, they can collapse at the site of the spots. The spots may be clear or less obvious. Although the spots may at first be insignificant, the disease has the potential of devastating the whole crop.

                    This virus is not seed transmitted. over-wintering onions, volunteers from prior productions, infected transplants and alternate hosts can all serve as sources of both vector and virus.

                <li>
                    During the early stages of this disease, the bulbs may appear healthy except for a softening of the neck tissue. In a longitudinal section, one or more inner scales become watery or cooked.
