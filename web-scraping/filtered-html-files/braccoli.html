            <ul>
                <li>
                    Damping off occurs in two stages, i.e. the pre-emergence and the post-emergence phase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the pre-emergence phase the seedlings are killed just before they reach the soil surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The young radical and the plumule are killed and there is complete rotting of the seedlings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The post-emergence phase is characterized by the infection of the young, juvenile tissues of the collar at the ground level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The infected tissues become soft and water soaked. The seedlings topple over or collapse.

                    High humidity, high soil moisture, cloudiness and low temperatures below 24° C for few days are ideal for infection and development of disease.

                    Crowded seedlings, dampness due to high rainfall, poor drainage and excess of soil solutes hamper plant growth and increase the pathogenic damping-off.
