            <ul>
                <li>
                    First symptoms start with the onset of monsoon. Appearance of light yellow foliage with loss of turgidity and epinasty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plants, at a later stage, show unthriftyness. Subsequently, premature shedding and defoliation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some of the twigs become bare and fail to bring forth new leaves or flowers and eventually dry up. Fruits of all the affected branches remain underdeveloped, hard and stony. Later, the entire plant is defoliated and eventually dies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The roots also show rotting at the basal region and the bark is easily detachable from the cortex. Light brown discoloration is also noticed in vascular tissues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The pathogen attacks young as well as old fruit bearing trees but older trees are more prone to the disease.

                <li>
                    Affected area is covered with whitish cotton like growth which develops very fast as the fruit matures and pathogen is able to cover almost the entire surface within a period of 3-4 days during humid weather.

                <li>
                    Under high relative humidity, the fruits near the soil level covered with dense foliage are most severely affected. The fallen fruits are badly affected.

                    The pathogen produces a great number of sporangia and spores on the surface of diseased tissues principally when the temperature is near 25Â°C and this is an important sources of inoculum in the development of epidemics.

                    Young shoots, leaves and fruits are readily attached, while they are still tender. The greenish colour of the growing tip is changed to dark brown and later to black necrotic areas extending backwards.

                    Fruit and leaf infection phase:  Fruit and leaf infection is generally seen during rainy season crop. Pin-head spots are first seen on unripe fruits, which gradually enlarge.

                <li>
                    Spots are dark brown in colour, sunken, circular and have minute black stromata in the center of the lesion, which produce creamy spore masses in moist weather.
