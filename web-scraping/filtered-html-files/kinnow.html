                The disease is identified by profuse gumming on the surface of the bark on tree

                    trunk from which gummy substance oozes out. The affected bark turns dark brown and develops longitudinal cracks. The wood tissues are also affected. In severe cases, bark rots and the trees dry because of girdling effect.

                    The disease is favoured by rains, heavy to ill drained soils, excessive and flood method of irrigation leading to prolonged contact of trunk and crown with water or moist soil, high water-table, deep planting, low budding and injuries to roots or base of the stem. The primary means by which

                    spp. are spread through citrus orchards is by use of infested nursery stock. The pathogen may be present in soil or infected roots even though disease symptoms are not readily apparent. The fungus like organism is also carried in soil on equipment when vehicles move from infested to non-infested groves or nurseries. Flooding method for irrigation water may also move the pathogen from area to area. Within groves, dispersal by irrigation water occurs especially where furrow or flood irrigation is used. Surface water following heavy rains may carry the pathogen as it drains from the grove.

                Citrus canker

                Causal organism :
                <i>
                    Xanthomonas citri

            </p>
            <p>
                This disease is endemic to India and occurs in all the citrus growing areas. It is a bacterial disease and is spread with the help of citrus leaf miner. Canker lesions start as pinpoint spots and attain a diameter of 2 - 10 mm. Their eventual size depends mainly on the cultivar and the age of the host tissue at infection. The lesions are initially circular but later may develop irregularly often aggregated at the leaf margin or the leaf tips or in a restricted area of the leaf. Lesion become visible on the underside of leaves about 7 days after infection and on the upper surface soon after. The characteristic symptom of the disease on leaves is the yellow halo that surrounds lesion. Young lessons are raised or pustular, particularly on the lower leaf surface. The pustules later became corky and crateriform, with a raised margin and a sunken centre. Lesions on fruit and stems extend 1-3 mm in depth and are superficially similar to those on leaves.

                Citrus scab attacks the fruit, leaves and twigs, producing slightly raised, irregular scabby or wart-like outgrowths. The scabs are grey or pinkish at first and become darker with age. They are more common on fruits than leaves. The raised lumps associated with scab can be confused with symptoms caused by citrus canker or with windrub abrasions. Spores of the fungus are readily produced on the surface of scab lesions on young fruits and leaves throughout the year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spores of the fungus are spread in the orchard by rain, overhead irrigation and during spraying operations. Dew may also cause the spores to be liberated from the lesions but due to the limited splashing action, there would only be localised dispersal.

                The range and severity of symptoms vary with season, type and extent of infection, age and nutritional status of the trees. Greening infected citrus leaves are generally small, upright and frequently have symptoms with green veins and chlorotic interveinal areas. Diseased leaves also show various types of chlorotic mottling. Leaf mottle is one of the best diagnostic symptoms of greening. In severe cases leaves become almost chlorotic with scattered dark green islands. Symptoms are often seen on part of the canopy or even only in a branch or a twig. Infected fruits are small and mis-shapen, many fall prematurely, while those that remain on the tree do not colour properly, remaining green on the stylar (lower) end and hence the origin of the name 'greening_. Greening disease is transmitted by infected budwoods and in the orchards through citrus psylla. Psylla picks the pathogen in nymphal stage and transmits it when adult.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The management of greening disease involves removal of affected  unproductive trees and their replacement by disease-free budded plants  developed on improved rootstock through proper indexing programme.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Regulatory (quarantine) measures should be strengthened to limit movement, sale and use of infected bud wood or nursery stock.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strict control of nurseries through registered disease-free certification scheme is essential to prevent the spread of disease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since the disease also spreads through the vector, citrus psylfa,  recommended insecticides given in the table should be applied to control  the disease spread.
