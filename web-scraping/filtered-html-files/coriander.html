                    It appears as small, white, powdery patches on young parts of stems, leaves and buds which increases in size, and coalesce to cover entire area of leaf surface.

                <li>
                    Affected leaves are reduced in size and distorted. Premature sterility is also common. in serve cases, the umbels dry up.

                    Seed formation may not take place in affected plants due to this disease.

                    The disease can easily be recognized in the field by drooping of the terminal portions, followed by withering and drying up of leaves, eventually resulting in death.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Discoloration of vascular system of the root is observed. Partial wilting is also found. In partially wilted plants, growth is arrested.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The leaves become pinkish yellow to yellow. Sterility is often noticed in such plants. Seeds, if formed are immature and light in weight.

                    Severe infection in the early stage results in total failure of the crop.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The disease appears in the form of tumor-like swellings of leafveins, leaf stalks, peduncles, stems as well as fruits. The infected veins show a swollen hanging appearance to the leaves.  Initially the tumors are glossy which rupture later on and become rough. They are about 3 mm broad and up to 12.5 mm long.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Badly affected plants may be killed. In the presence of excessive soil moisture, especially under shaded conditions, when the stem fails to harden and remain succulent, the tumors are numerous.
