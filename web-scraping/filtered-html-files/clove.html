                Seedling wilt
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Disease symptom:
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Seedling wilt is observed mainly in nurseries and causes 5 to 40% death of seedlings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leaves of affected seedlings loose natural luster, tend to droop and ultimately die.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The root system and collar region of the seedling show varying degrees of discolouration and decay.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                Survival and spread:
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The fungus is soil-borne and remains in the soil as saprophyte for 2-3 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The secondary spread is aided by wind, rain and irrigation water.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li>
                    High day temperature (30-35ËšC).

                <li>
                    Low humidity (50-60%).

                    Low soil moisture and alkaline soils

                Leaf rot:
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Disease symptom:
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It is noticed in the nurseries as well as in the main field both at young and mature stages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Infection starts as dark spots at the leaf margin and spreads sometimes with no definite pattern.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rotting may be in the whole leaf or at the tip resulting in defoliation.
                </li>
            </ul>

                Favourable conditions:
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The fungus survives on diseased twigs and mummified fruits, either on the tree or on the ground.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fungul spores are air-borne and are also spread by rain splash and insects. Moderate temperatures and moist weather during bloom favour the disease
                </li>
            </ul>

                Disease symptom:
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Necrotic spots of variable size and shapes are noticed on the leaves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Severely affected leaves wither, droop and dry up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Twigs are infected as the symptoms extend from the leaves through petioles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The affected branches stand without leaves or only with young leaves at tips.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Flower buds are attacked by spreading infection from the twigs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shedding of flower buds occurs during periods of heavy and continuous rainfall.
                </li>
