                    Symptoms of decay and signs of the pathogen develop as shriveled fruit that may have gray fungal growth mostly at the stem end and occasionally around the sepals or over the entire surface of the fruit. Diseased internal fruit tissues appear water-soaked and dark green. In advanced stages of the disease black, irregular-shaped sclerotia of the fungus up to about 0.2 inch (5 mm) in diameter may form on the infected fruit.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The pathogen causes a reddish brown dry cortical root rot that may extend into the base of the stem. Later in the season, infections at the base of the plant (cortical rot) may result in plants snapping off during high winds. Foliar symptoms yellowing or wilting of leaves.
