                    Humidity is an important factor related to the onset and spread of powdery mildew. High relative humidity favors spore formation, and low relative humidity favors spore dispersal, which explains why powdery mildew tends to be a problem when the days are cool and the nights are humid.

                    Rhizoctonia root rot develops from infection of the growing tip of small lateral roots. The fungus then progressively grows from the root tip and may cause rot of the main root. Rhizoctonia infection of a rootlet often results in the „spear-point‟ symptom of roots.
